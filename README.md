# **Face Detection and Recognition Project**
The Face Detection and Recognition Project is a Python-based tool that helps you detect faces in static images and recognize individuals in real-time using your webcam. It utilizes the face_recognition and OpenCV libraries to provide fast and accurate results
# *Intoduction*
The Face Detection and Recognition Project solves the problem of detecting and identifying people in both images and video streams. It is built to be a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use solution for face detection and recognition tasks, providing a better alternative to traditional methods.
# *Installation*
1. Clone the repository:**`https://github.com/Yatendra-K-yadav/face-recognition-1.3.0.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd face-detection-recognition`**
3. Install dependencies:
   1. Download [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)
   2. download [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
   3. donload the build distribution file i:e the whl from from [face recognition library](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) it will download dlib as well as face recognition library
4. Set up your images and sample data under the **`images/`** directory.

**run the code and you are good to go**
